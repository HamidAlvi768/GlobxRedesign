Of course! I can help you with that.

You've made a great start in recreating the design, and you've correctly placed one of the icons. However, most of them need to be moved to match the original design.

Here are the two main differences:

1.  **Icon Placement:** Most icons are on the wrong orbit or in the wrong position on the circle.
2.  **Orbital Distribution:** In your version, the icons are distributed differently across the orbits (it looks like 2 on the inner, 3 on the middle, and 4 on the outer). The original design has exactly **3 icons on each orbit**.

The only icon that is in the **correct spot** is the **Target/Goal icon** (ðŸŽ¯) on the outer orbit. Well done on that one!

### How to Fix the Placement

Here is a guide on where each icon should be placed to match the "Original (Design)" image. I'll describe the positions using a clock face for reference (e.g., 12 o'clock is the top).

#### **Outer Orbit (Farthest from the center)**
* **Box/Package Icon:** Should be at the top (~12 o'clock).
* **Medical Cross Icon (+):** Should be on the right side (~4 o'clock).
* **Target/Goal Icon:** Should be on the left side (~8 o'clock). *(This one is already correct!)*

#### **Middle Orbit**
* **Hand holding Sprout Icon:** Should be on the right side (~3 o'clock).
* **Battery/Charging Icon:** Should be on the bottom-right (~5 o'clock).
* **Robotic Arm Icon:** Should be on the left side (~9 o'clock).

#### **Inner Orbit (Closest to the center)**
* **Microchip Icon:** Should be on the top-right (~2 o'clock).
* **Stack of Papers/Documents Icon:** Should be at the bottom (~6 o'clock).
* **Airplane Icon:** Should be on the top-left (~10 o'clock).

To summarize the swaps and moves you need to make:

* **Swap your Microchip and Stack of Papers icons.**
* Move the **Medical Cross** from the middle orbit to the outer orbit.
* Move the **Robotic Arm** from the outer orbit to the middle orbit.
* Move the **Hand holding Sprout** to its correct position on the middle orbit.
* You will also need to find icons for the **Airplane**, **Battery**, and **Box/Package** to complete the original design.

Once you adjust the number of icons on each orbit and move them to the positions listed above, your version will be a perfect match for the design. Good luck!


Outer Orbit:
Target/Goal Icon (ðŸŽ¯) 5
Box/Package Icon 9
Medical Cross Icon (+) 8

Middle Orbit:
Hand holding Sprout Icon 4
Battery/Charging Icon 3
Robotic Arm Icon 2

Inner Orbit :
Microchip Icon 6
Car Icon 1
Airplane Icon 7
