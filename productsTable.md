Of course. Based on the image, the primary issue with this UI is the **complete separation of the data labels from the data values**.

This design is highly unconventional and creates several problems for the user.

### Key Issues

* **Poor Data Association:** The user is forced to mentally map the labels in the top section (MPN, BRAND, etc.) to the corresponding values in the section below (RC0402FR-0788K7L, Yageo, etc.). This increases cognitive load and makes the information difficult and slow to process. ðŸ§ 
* **Not Scalable:** This layout is confusing with just one item. If there were multiple items listed, it would be nearly impossible to understand, as the single set of headers would seem to apply to all items at once.
* **Inefficient Scannability:** A standard table allows users to scan horizontally to see all the details of one item, or scan vertically to compare a specific attribute (like price) across multiple items. This design prevents both of these common and efficient user behaviors.
* **Wasted Space:** The layout results in a large amount of unused white space, making the interface feel sparse and poorly organized.

### How to Fix It

The solution is to place labels directly next to their corresponding data. There are two standard and effective ways to do this:

1.  **Standard Table (for Desktop/Wide Screens):** This is the most common and effective solution for displaying this type of data.

| MPN | BRAND | QUANTITY AVAILABLE | PRICE | ACTION |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| RC0402FR-0788K7L | Yageo | 1,000,000 | 0.00008 | `[View]` |

2.  **Card Layout (for Mobile/Narrow Screens):** For smaller screens, a card-based layout for each item is often better.

> **MPN:** RC0402FR-0788K7L
>
> **Brand:** Yageo
>
> **Quantity Available:** 1,000,000
>
> **Price:** 0.00008
>
> `[View Button]`
